# Privacy Policy for Scout Accountability

**Last updated:** December 07, 2025  

Scout Accountability (“the Extension”) is a Chrome browser extension designed to help users stay accountable by detecting visits to user-defined blocked websites and sending alert emails to an accountability partner. This Privacy Policy explains what data the Extension accesses, how it is used, and how it is protected.

---

## 1. Information We Access

Scout Accountability only accesses data necessary to perform its single purpose. The Extension may access the following information:

### 1.1 Web History (URLs Visited)
- The Extension reads the URL of the active tab to determine whether it matches a site on the user’s blocked-site list.  
- No browsing history is stored, logged, profiled, or transmitted unless the URL is on the blocked list **and** an alert is triggered.

### 1.2 Website Content (Screenshots)
When the user visits a blocked website, the Extension captures a screenshot of the active tab.

Screenshots are:
- sent directly to the user’s designated accountability partner  
- **not** kept by the Extension  
- **not** analyzed, stored, or used for any other purpose  

### 1.3 User-Provided Settings
The Extension stores the following settings locally using Chrome Storage:
- list of blocked sites  
- accountability partner’s email address  
- monitoring on/off state  

This data never leaves the user’s device unless an alert is triggered.

---

## 2. Information We Do **Not** Collect

Scout Accountability does **not** collect, store, or process:
- names  
- addresses  
- passwords  
- financial information  
- personal communications  
- keystrokes  
- analytics or tracking data  
- advertising identifiers  

The Extension does **not** track users across websites for any reason other than blocked-site detection.

---

## 3. When Data Is Transmitted

Data is transmitted **only** when an alert is triggered.

When a blocked site is visited, the Extension sends:
- the URL  
- the page title  
- a screenshot  
- a timestamp  

This information is sent only to:
- **The user’s backend server hosted on Vercel** (to process the email)  
- **SendGrid**, an email delivery provider (to send the alert email)  

These services act strictly on behalf of the Extension to deliver its core functionality.

---

## 4. Data Sharing

Scout Accountability does **not**:
- sell user data  
- share data with advertisers  
- share data with analytics services  
- transfer data for unrelated purposes  

Data is shared only with necessary service providers (Vercel and SendGrid) and solely for sending alert emails selected by the user. These providers do not use the data for their own purposes.

---

## 5. Data Retention

- The Extension does **not** retain screenshots.  
- The Extension does **not** store visited URLs.  
- Local settings remain on the user’s device until the user removes the Extension or clears Chrome data.

---

## 6. Security

- All communication with the backend server and SendGrid uses **HTTPS encryption**, protecting data during transmission.  
- Email transmissions may pass through third-party mail servers as part of normal email delivery.

---

## 7. User Control

Users may:
- enable or disable monitoring  
- add or remove blocked sites  
- update or remove the accountability partner’s email  
- uninstall the Extension at any time, which removes all locally stored settings  

---

## 8. Compliance With Chrome Web Store Policies

Scout Accountability complies with:
- Google Chrome Web Store User Data Policies  
- Limited Use Requirements  
- Single-Purpose and Data Minimization Standards  

All accessed data is used solely for blocked-site detection and alert notifications.

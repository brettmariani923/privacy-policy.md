Privacy Policy for Scout Accountability

Last updated: December 07, 2025

Scout Accountability (“the Extension”) is a Chrome browser extension designed to help users stay accountable by detecting visits to user-defined blocked websites and sending alert emails to an accountability partner. This Privacy Policy explains what data the Extension accesses, how it is used, and how it is protected.


1. Information We Access

  Scout Accountability only accesses data necessary to perform its single purpose. The Extension may access the following information:


1.1 Web History (URLs visited)

  The Extension reads the URL of the active tab to determine whether it matches a site on the user’s blocked-site list.
  No browsing history is stored, logged, profiled, or transmitted unless the URL is on the blocked list and an alert is triggered.


1.2 Website Content (Screenshots)

  When the user visits a blocked website, the Extension captures a screenshot of the active tab.
  Screenshots are:
  
  sent directly to the user’s designated accountability partner
  
  not kept by the extension
  
  not analyzed, stored, or used for any other purpose


1.3 User-Provided Settings

  The Extension stores the following settings locally using Chrome storage:
  
  list of blocked sites
  
  accountability partner’s email address
  
  on/off monitoring state
  
  This data never leaves the user’s device unless an alert is triggered.


2. Information We Do NOT Collect

  Scout Accountability does not collect, store, or process:
  
  names
  
  addresses
  
  passwords
  
  financial information
  
  personal communications
  
  keystrokes
  
  analytics or tracking data
  
  advertising identifiers
  
  The Extension does not track users across websites for any reason other than blocked-site detection.


3. When Data Is Transmitted

  Data is transmitted only when an alert is triggered.
  
  When a blocked site is visited, the Extension sends:
  
  the URL
  
  the page title
  
  a screenshot
  
  a timestamp
  
  This information is sent only to:
  
  The user’s backend server hosted on Vercel (to process email sending)
  
  SendGrid, an email delivery provider (to send the alert email)
  
  These services act strictly on behalf of the Extension to deliver its core functionality.


4. Data Sharing

  Scout Accountability does not:
  
  sell user data
  
  share data with advertisers
  
  share data with analytics services
  
  transfer data for unrelated purposes
  
  Data is shared only with service providers (Vercel and SendGrid) and only for the purpose of sending an alert email chosen by the user.
  These providers do not use the data for their own purposes.


5. Data Retention

  The Extension does not retain screenshots.
  
  The Extension does not store visited URLs.
  
  Local settings remain on the user’s device until the user removes the Extension or clears Chrome’s data.


6. Security

  The Extension uses HTTPS encryption for all communication with the backend server and SendGrid, protecting data during transmission.
  Email transmissions themselves may pass through third-party mail servers as part of normal email delivery.


7. User Control

  Users may:
  
  enable or disable monitoring
  
  add or remove blocked sites
  
  update or remove the accountability partner’s email
  
  uninstall the Extension at any time, which removes all locally stored settings


8. Compliance With Chrome Web Store Policies

  Scout Accountability complies with:
  
  Google Chrome Web Store User Data Policies
  
  Limited Use Requirements
  
  Single-Purpose and Data Minimization Standards
  
  All accessed data is used solely for blocked-site detection and alert notifications.
